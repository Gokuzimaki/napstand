    <img src="../images/lucimstar.jpg" height="112px"style="float:left;"/> Millions of years ago God almighty created the heavens and the earth. This period according to the Bible was referred to as the beginning. Genesis 1:1
The earth then was beautifully built and designed by the Almighty God. It was full of beautiful stones, sparkling rivers and exciting animals including flying reptiles, mammals, lovely birds and so many creatures that are today no longer existing.
God then designed a lovely abode in Eden Ezekiel 28:12 (Eden means fruitful in Aramic). This first Eden was actually a mountainous garden full of lovely sparkling precious stones; including Sardis, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle and gold. It was called the mountain of God.
The Lord now created spirit beings in His image but not in His likeness, so in appearance they look like God but in form, nature and ability they are not like God, these spirit beings God called Angels.
